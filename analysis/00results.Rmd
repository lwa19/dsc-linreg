Let's take a look at the DSC results:

```{r}
library(dscr)
library(dscrutils)
dscout <- dscquery(dsc.outdir = "../benchmark",
                   targets    = c("simulate.scenario","analyze","score.err"))
dscr::shiny_plot(subset(dscout,score == "pred_err"),
				 "simulate.scenario","analyze")
dscr::shiny_plot(subset(dscout,score == "coef_err"),
				 "simulate.scenario","analyze")
```
