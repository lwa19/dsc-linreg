In this short analysis, we compare the prediction accuracy of several
linear regression in the four simulation examples described in [Zou &
Hastie (2005)][zou-hastie-2005]. The methods compared are:

+ ridge regression;

+ the Lasso;

+ the Elastic Net;

+ Sum of Single Effects regression (SuSiE), described [here][susie];

+ variational inference for Bayesian variable selection, or "varbvs",
described [here][varbvs]; and

+ "varbvsmix", an elaboration of varbvs that replaces the single normal
  prior with a mixture-of-normals.
